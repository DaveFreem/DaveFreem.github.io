It’s really intriguing/comforting to think of internet culture/rules as things that can be left in the realm of the internet.
In their presentation The Internet with a Human Face, Maciej Ceglowski brings up an example of how a frightening aspect of the 
internet began to explicitly infiltrate our physical world: 

> “Google glasses [tries] to bring the online rule into the offline world. Suddenly, anything can be recorded, and there’s the 
expectation… that everything will be recorded.” 

There are distinctly negative things that have emerged from paths that the mainstream internet has taken, but it can offer comfort to look at that culture as 
distinct and manufactured and emergent.

I do wonder though how accurate it is for me to segregate these two parts of our lives. I’m feeling like Ceglowski is bringing up a
point that doesn’t hinge on that dichotomy, but it is difficult to toy with the effects of the internet’s path in a way requires it
to be out of touch with the non-internet world. I drew out the image that came to my mind, since my word-writing ability isn’t 
representing my thought well.

The bottom sketch shows an internet that can evolve without checking in with or effecting the non-internet world, allowing it to 
make tangible impact at acute moments.
