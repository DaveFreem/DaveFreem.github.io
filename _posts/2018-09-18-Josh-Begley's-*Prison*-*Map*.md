Josh Begley’s [*Prison Map*](http://prisonmap.com/) is a piece that attempts to subvert (what I see as) data-centric perspectives and explanations for the
United States’ positioning as the prison capital of the world. When writing about the oft-trot explanations for growing 
imprisonment, Begley lists through numbers, dates, and charts as examples. Then he presents *his* representation; a long scroll of 
satellite photographs that each depict a US prison aerially. When I first saw this piece, I approached it as Begley’s way of adding
heart to the depersonalized data that we more often see when talking about the prison system. 

But in their presentation, these photographs only add to the depersonalized *datafication* of the United States’ prison system. 
The images are arranged in a seemingly endless grid for to scroll through. They are given no context; all that they can speak for
is what they show as images. And the photographs are devoid of humanity, representing the same barren abstraction that is shown 
when you find your own home on Google Maps, only to realize how devoid of character this birds-eye view is.

I think that Begley set forth with a misguided question. The Prison Map website describes that the piece is asking what the 
geography of incarceration in the United States looks like. What does that question do to bring us away from viewing the prison 
system through a lens of abstracted data? If Begley is exploring the geography of incarceration, what is that meant to prove? 
Looking through these images, I think that they *do* show interesting landscapes: some geometric constructions on otherwise empty 
land, some tight pockets surrounded by forest, some indistinguishable from the buildings around them. But I don’t see the 
importance in exploring the geography of the US prison system when that act itself continues to drive the typical distanced and
data-centric conversations.
