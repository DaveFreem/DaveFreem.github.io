## My Thoughts:  

### What is the role of originality and uniqueness in work whose creator is living in a mass-media world?  
  
> "What makes bad writing universal is that it lacks detail, originality, specificity and a sense of character and place, it depends on generalisations and clichés (both in terms of language and story), and it only reproduces common tropes and ideas which are propagated in mainstream literature, film, television, music and radio, making it so unremarkable that it could have been written anywhere by anyone at any time."

I feel like Ahmad focused a lot of this piece on how bad writing is cliche and generic whereas good writing is original
and unique to the writer's unique experience. That doesn't quite acknowledge some central dynamic that come
along with being a consumer of mass media. In my eyes, any creator who consumes global or widely shared media lives and
creates in a style that is derived from those other things, and there is value in a voice that expresses or even reflects
the effects of that positioning.  
Whether writing is *unique* or *cliche*, it is still contributing to the expansive body of content that itself is consumed
by future people, who create work that is influenced by the content around them. And it doesn't seem like Ahmad offers a 
bigger purpose that unique, original writing serves, other than appeasing the folks who request that such writing continues 
to be produced for the sake of "good writing".

#### And then a brief, tangentially related thought:
At one point, Ahmad mentions a piece of writing he came across that veered out of its set point of view:
> "how can a writer know that a look of disbelief had washed over her face if she’s writing from the first-person 
perspective?"

This just makes me think about how consuming media, from horror movies to Netflix rom-coms to first-person novels, puts me
in a space of acting as if I were the subject of these works. Not meaning I feel like I'm in my own sort of Truman Show, 
just that there is an empowering effect to feeling like I'm part of a delightful gift of something that those around me have
the pleasure of witness / consume / participate in.  
All said, this mood of *"A look of disbelief washed over my face"* deserves much more thought than being dismissed as bad 
writing.

### Other things that I want to hang on to / keep thinking about:
* I want to question thhis thing that *"you need to know these rules even if it's just to break them"*
 
* I feel like Ahmad has a weird position of power as the critic of others' writing and as a teller of their stories and he sometimes uses that power in mean/judgy way.

* When giving critiques, he seemed to have an attitude that his input was *the* input of a "good writer" and that other good
writers would certainly agree with that. It's a weird elite-club feeling

* A well-stated thought or mood should itself suffice when I'm trying to make a point:
  > "either comments like ‘fuck you’ are sufficiently offensive that a writer/narrator does not need to stress how offensive they are by saying they are ‘roars’ or ‘spits of venom’, or the comments are simply not offensive and the writer is just forcing the idea that they are offensive on us because the comment and reaction to the comment don’t carry their own weight."
