### Social credit and The Good Place

When I [read](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit) about China's gradually-implimented social credit system, I had trouble figuring out a take. It's such a reflection of the day-to-day online and social life that I've come to accept, just maybe with a deeper Black Mirror-y (Orwellian) resonance. The surprise of it is that its actually being done, but its core idea doesn't feel like a fresh evil. There's a lens though that can give it some new *umph*, and it's that of an NBC sitcom.

*The Good Place* imagines a universe in which humans are sorted into an afterlife based on the sum goodness of their actions back in living life. The determining factor for where a human spends their eternity is a score; do something good and get some points, do something bad and lose some points, do something really good and get a bunch of points. I think there is some interesting potential to thinking down this trail. In the social credit system, rather than there being a border between your actions and the system's response to your actions (as it is in *The Good Place* and several faith traditions), your choice-action-situation is actively shaped and re-evaluated by the mistakes that you make. The punitive (or rewarding) feedback is shaping people's environment, influencing the bad (or good) decisions that they make in the future.

### Project 3 ideation

I'm currently leaning towards exploring how creating an art piece is similar to creating artificial intelligence, since that piece then stands alone to relate whatever sort of thoughts that you put into it. Below, I've listed a handful of ways that this could be reflected in a project:

(if this is all you're seeing, I'm sorry, I am returning to this post on Tuesday to fill it in with fleshed-out thoughts)
