### Social Credit and The Good Place

When I [read](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit) about China's gradually-implimented social credit system, I had trouble figuring out a take. It's such a reflection 
of the day-to-day online and social life that I've come to accept, just maybe with a deeper Black Mirror-y (Orwellian) resonance. The
surprise of it is that its actually being done, but its core idea doesn't feel like a fresh evil. There's a lens though that can give
it some new *umph*, and it's that of an NBC sitcom.

*The Good Place* imagines a universe in which humans are sorted into an afterlife based on the sum goodness of their actions back in
living life. The determining factor for where a human spends their eternity is a score; do something good and get some points, do something bad
and lose some points, do something really good and get a bunch of points.
